How to run it?
1. run buildData.py, it will produce parents.json and activities.json two files.
2. run printActs.py, it will print out activities for each mother.

Future works:
1. Make the print out contents more friendly.
2. Collect raw data(maybe csv format) and add automatic method to build up our data(assume json format)
3. testSMS.py can work, so it can combine with other .py file to send Message to mothers
4. Add new functions as we need 
5. Bug fix
